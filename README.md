# Comlink's Zeta Players

As you probably know, StarFrost has stopped development on their Zeta mod. I intend to pick up where they left off and improve the Zeta experience. Improvements I would like to make include text chat lines that interact with the player, and the ability to type messages tied to a song such as lyrics.

I will also make major additions to the default panel information and rework some of the existing content. Expect WAY more text chat lines and a more comfortable listening experience.
