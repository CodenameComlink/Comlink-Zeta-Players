# Zeta Players

What are the Zeta Players? Zeta Players are nextbots designed to play sandbox. This means I have provided the weapons and tools to allow them to do that so they can do whatever they want. They will teach you on how it FEELS to play sandbox.

Zeta Players have been in development for several months now and it is time that the Zetas have their own github for ease of coding without having to post in the Discord
